### Project Description
Our project is a web app designed to help students reduce stress and enhance productivity while studying. It includes features like a timer, to-do list, diary, breathing exercises, motivational quotes, and games like Flappy Bird and Hangman. The app promotes focus, balance, and enjoyable¬†study¬†breaks.
### The Problem statement
Students often struggle with managing stress caused by overwhelming workloads, which affects their ability to maintain focus and productivity. The pressure to meet academic demands can lead to burnout, especially when effective stress-relief tools are unavailable. There is a need for a solution that seamlessly integrates productivity and relaxation techniques into students‚Äô study routines to help them achieve balance¬†and¬†efficiency.
### The Solution
Our solution is a web app designed to help students manage stress and enhance productivity through a combination of effective tools and engaging features. The app includes a timer, to-do list, and diary to organize tasks and track progress, while offering relaxation options like breathing exercises and motivational quotes to promote mental well-being. Additionally, fun games such as Flappy Bird and Hangman provide refreshing study breaks, creating a balanced approach to academic success. By integrating productivity, relaxation, and entertainment in one platform, the app empowers students to focus better, reduce stress, and achieve their goals¬†efficiently.
